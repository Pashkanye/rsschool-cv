## About Me
I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation 
that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and 
learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to edit
videos in Adobe Premiere to explain a problem for engineers from Germany.
